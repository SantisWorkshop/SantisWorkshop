- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Santiago and this is my git page... I mean workshop. This was supposed to be a MTG nod to Mishra's Workshop. Here you'll find some of the stuff I code, mainly from my directed study.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Data Science and Machine Learning. I have an M.S in Mathematics and have really delved in the theory, but currently I am trying to do more projects to actually make all this theory actually useful. I am a fan of King of the Hill and consume lots of media, maybe why I haven't done a lot of projects lol. I also like learning about food. I belive if we know what we eat or how food comes to our table, we can make better informed decisions and make things a bit more sustainable for us.  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning, how to improve my programming using R and Python. I also know MATLAB.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me just follow me @RatchetZinogre on Twitter, I rarely post, but I could use some followers.
